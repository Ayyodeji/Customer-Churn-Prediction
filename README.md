# Telecommunication Customer Churn Prediction with ANN, CNN, and RNN

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing telecommunication customer churn prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to build and compare different deep learning models to predict customer churn in the telecommunication industry.

## Project Overview

As a data scientist, you have been assigned the task of developing a customer churn prediction model for a telecommunication company. In this project, you will explore and preprocess the customer churn dataset, create and train ANN, CNN, and RNN models using TensorFlow, and evaluate their performance. The project aims to identify potential churners and provide insights to help the company improve customer retention strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Ayyodeji/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
cd Customer-Churn-Prediction

2. Set up the environment:
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with Jupyter Notebook.
- Install the required dependencies:

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

4. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook `Telecom_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`.

5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build the ANN, CNN, and RNN models, and evaluate their performance.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook `Telecom_Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, build and train the ANN, CNN, and RNN models, and evaluate their performance.

4. Experiment with different hyperparameters, architectures, or techniques to improve the performance of the models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about telecommunication customers, including various features and the churn status. The dataset is provided within the repository in the `data` directory.

## Resources

- TensorFlow: an open-source machine learning framework used for building and training neural networks.
- Python: the programming language used for implementing the models and performing data analysis.
